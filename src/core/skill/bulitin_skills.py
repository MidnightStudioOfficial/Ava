Built-in Skills Module

This module defines a class to manage built-in skills for an AI assistant application. It imports specific skills from their respective modules and instantiates them, creating instances of each skill class. The instantiated skills are stored in a dictionary, allowing easy access and management of the skills by using their intents as keys.

The `BuiltinSkills` class is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Importing specific skills from their respective modules.
2. Instantiating each skill class derived from the `BaseSkill` class.
3. Storing the instantiated skills in the `self.skills` dictionary with the skill intent as the key.

The `skills_list` variable is not directly used within this class, but it could be used to store additional information about each skill, such as their name, description, or other relevant data, if needed elsewhere in the application.

Please note that the `BaseSkill` class and its subclasses are expected to be defined in the appropriate modules before using this module.
