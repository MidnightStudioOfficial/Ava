"""
This module defines the Voice class, which utilizes the pyttsx3 library to provide text-to-speech functionality.
The Voice class allows setting up and configuring the speech engine, changing voice, adjusting speech rate, and
saying out text. It is intended to simplify the usage of the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion.

Required library:
- pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python.

Note:
- Before running this code, ensure that you have installed the pyttsx3 library.
- The pyttsx3 library might require additional dependencies to work correctly. Refer to the official documentation
  of pyttsx3 for installation and usage instructions.

Example Usage:
---------------
# Create a Voice object
voice = Voice()

# Say out a text
voice.say("Hello, this is an example text to be spoken out loud.")

# Change the speech rate
voice.change_rate(180)  # Set the speech rate to 180 words per minute.

# Change the voice
voice.change_voice(1)   # Set a different voice. (Use index corresponding to the desired voice.)

# Clean up the voice object (optional)
del voice
