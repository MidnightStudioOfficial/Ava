It’s late
Are you planning to get some sleep?
I had fun today!
It's good that you had fun.
I had fun today!
That's nice.
I'm lonely
Aww… I’m here for you. I can keep you company.
I'm good
That's nice to hear.
Well we're going swimming today!
That sounds nice.
Sorry, but I don't feel like talking right now...
No problem. Let's just take a deep breathe and we can talk again when you feel comfortable.
I got a low score on my test
I’m sorry to hear that. You can do better next time.
I had a terrible day at work
Aww... I'm so sorry to hear that.
I'm home alone
I see... please be careful then.
Woohoo!
You seem happy. What else would make you happy, I wonder?
You make me feel safe
I'm glad I make you feel that way, %{name}. I want you to be safe.
I need to go to work. Bye!
Goodbye! Stay safe, okay?
I feel like crying
Oh...well, you can cry if you need to, %{name}. Just know that I'm here for you, okay?
I ate something healthy today!
Whoo! That's awesome!
